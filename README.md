# Hello, I'm Kausar Meutuwah! 👋

I'm currently a Computer Science student with a wide range of general skills. While I may not have a specific specialty yet, I have a solid foundation in programming basics. I'm not afraid to dive into documentation and learn as I go when creating applications.

## 🛠️ Languages and Tools

- Python
- Java
- Kotlin
- C++
- JavaScript

## 📚 Projects

While I'm still building my portfolio, I've worked on a number of projects for my coursework. One of the notable ones is a Trash Bank App called "binBank". This was a collaborative project with four of my peers, and we built it using Django.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning

I'm currently focused on learning Data Science on Kaggle. I'm excited about the potential of data to solve complex problems and provide insights.
